# Georgia
Georgia is a theme for foobar2000 designed to change dynamically based on album art. It's original purpose was to be used on a HTPC so it has large album artwork, plenty of logos and other eye candy. Over time it's evolved to add a playlist and other features which make it perfectly suitable for using on a desktop as well. It can be run in a window and it resizes pretty well, but it usually looks best at full screen.

Georgia also supports 4k resolutions, and will adjust based on window size.

### Installation Instructions

Unlike most themes I don't include an .fcl with mine. This makes getting setup *slightly* more work for you, but ensures that you can use it however you want. It works with both DUI and CUI, and all it really requires is a single [JScript Panel](https://github.com/marc2k3/foo_jscript_panel/releases) version 2.1.1 or greater.

I run the theme in Columns UI with a super simple setup using the JScript Panel, an auto-hiding vertical splitter, and two filter panels. You can see my setup [here](https://imgur.com/nJ71Vn1). Currently there's no library search mechanism built in, so unless you use foo_http_control (which I also recommend for HTPC use!), choosing what to play will be limited to your current playlists.

##### Step-by-step guide (please follow closely)

1. Close foobar
2. Download this theme.
3. Extract it into a folder named `georgia` to your foobar profile folder. On a non-portable installation this will typically be `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\foobar2000`.
4. Open up the `\georgia\fonts` folder and install all fonts located there. If you miss this step things will look terrible.
5. *(Optional Step)*  Download any of the image packs you like and place them in a folder called `images` in your foobar profile folder. See below for image pack locations.
6. If you don't have foo_jscript_panel installed already, grab the latest version [here](https://github.com/marc2k3/foo_jscript_panel/releases).
7. *(Optional Step)* This theme also makes heavy use of [the foo_enhanced_playcount](https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_enhanced_playcount) component. I recommend installing that as well, otherwise the timeline will not be as interesting. You'll probably also want [foo_playcount](https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_playcount) if you don't have that one yet.
8. Now add JScript Panel to a new theme. If you're using CUI I recommend the setup I'm [using](https://imgur.com/nJ71Vn1) but feel free to configure it how you want. Typically it will look best if the panel takes up the majority of foobar. Close foobar's properties.
9. Now right click on the JScript panel and select Configure. In the dialog that opens up, first make sure the Script Engine is set to "Chakra". Now select all the text in the text box and replace it with the contents of [Georgia.txt](https://github.com/kbuffington/Georgia/blob/master/Georgia.txt). It should look something like [this](https://imgur.com/3Ekc1HL). Hit OK and if you followed the instructions, the theme should have loaded working properly. If it didn't, most likely file paths are wrong. Check the console for more information.


### Theme Highlights and Secrets

* I think I invented the first "fanart" theme several years ago, and Georgia is the culmination of years of work on that front. It's designed to look amazing and display your artwork front and center. If you have Cycle Through All Artwork enabled, it will first show folder.jpg and then every 30 seconds switch to the next artwork in the folder. It can also display cdArt and vinylArt as well. These images are NOT automatically downloaded, but you can get them from https://fanart.tv. I recommend using AlbumArtDownloader for this. cdArt needs to be named either cd.png or cd1.png, cd2.png, etc. If you include a number, then the correct cdArt will be shown for the currently playing album.
* This theme is heavily dependent on special tags, which may be non-standard. Right clicking on the JScript Panel allows you to open the Properties page. If you scroll down to the "Tag Fields" section you can change the title-formatting strings for almost every field displayed.
* The theme is vinyl friendly! If the "Use Vinyl Style Numbering if Available" option is checked, the theme will look for `%vinyl side%` and `%vinyl tracknumber%` fields (configurable in the properties page!) and if it finds them you your track numbers will look like "A1" and "B4" instead of "01". Also sometimes fanart.tv has vinylArt available for albums. You can save those files as `vinyl.png` or `vinylA.png`, `vinylB.png` and the correct images will be used.
* Theme includes a "timeline" bar between the Title and Album Name which is a graphical representation of the songs lifetime in your library. If you're using foo_playcount and foo_enhanced_playcount the timeline bar it will look something like [this](https://imgur.com/2tChYuD). The left edge is when the song was first added to your library and the right edge is the current moment in time. The darker bar on the left is the time between added and first played, and the light bar on the right is time between last_played and today. If you have foo_enhanced_playcount, every song play in it's database will be reflected as a vertical line. If you play the song multiple times on the same day (and all plays map to the same pixel) that line will get darker.
* The playlist has Hyperlinks! Mouse over Artist, Year, Genre, or Record Label and you should see a line appear underneath. Clicking on it will search your library for all songs with those values. These hyperlinks are also multi-value aware in case you have multiple genres or record labels listed.
* Check out the options menu. It will allow you to easily change many visual settings, and configure certain theme settings. These options will be updated frequently as the theme is developed.
* And lots more...

### Image Packs

These packs will all need to be extracted to a folder called `images` which you will need to create in your foobar profile folder.

* **[Artist Logos](https://github.com/kbuffington/georgia-image-packs/raw/master/artistlogos-2018-06-29.rar)**: Extract to `.../AppData/Roaming/foobar2000/images/`
* **[Flags](https://github.com/kbuffington/georgia-image-packs/raw/master/flags.rar)**: Extract to `.../AppData/Roaming/foobar2000/images/`
* **[Record Labels](https://github.com/kbuffington/georgia-image-packs/raw/master/recordlabel.rar)**: Extract to `.../AppData/Roaming/foobar2000/images/`

Image pack repo: https://github.com/kbuffington/georgia-image-packs - I recommend starring this repo. I'll be releasing incremental updates of the image packs every month.

### Thanks

Thanks goes to Peter for fb2k. Also massive thanks to Marc2003 for foo_jscript_panel. Also, 90% of the playlist is ripped directly from TheQwertiest's amazing "CaTRoX (QWR)" theme. Thanks to him for his hard work, putting up with my stupid ideas, and letting me use it here.
